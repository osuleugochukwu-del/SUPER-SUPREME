# Trade Avata v10.1.0 Full Native — Final Test Report

Final local validation before packaging:

- Repository tests: **75/75 passed**
- Package verification: **passed**
- Transition/Renko randomized stress: **100,000 passed**
- Full-native randomized geometry/transition stress: **100,000 passed**
- Native geometry/axis/Home/timeframe-anchor stress: **100,000 passed**
- Final price-scale/oscillator/blank-range parity stress: **1,000 passed**
- Runtime source syntax checks: **passed**
- Production runtime scan: **no external Lightweight Charts / TradingView renderer dependency** in `index.html`, `src/`, or `sw.js`
- Current-repository preservation comparison: **0 of 52 existing baseline files missing**
- `ChartPane` interface audit: every detected baseline method remains available

The final parity stress explicitly checks current-price/Bid/Ask labels, candle countdown data, oscillator fixed ranges, small-mobile dimensions and out-of-range blank-chart protection.

A headless Chromium smoke test was attempted. This build environment blocks browser navigation to localhost and file URLs by administrator policy, so device/browser visual validation must still be performed on the deployed GitHub Pages build.
