# Full Native Preservation Audit — v10.1.0

The comparison baseline is the currently deployed `SUPER-CHART-AVATA` repository state at commit `7c7a7cdffa01e2ec953972a91d8a4afd4a0cfb16`.

## Result

Every one of the **52 existing baseline files is present** in this package. No existing file was dropped.

Important working modules left byte-for-byte unchanged include:

- AI client
- drawing engine
- data engine
- analytics
- market intelligence
- sharing
- workspace sync
- indicator security gate
- alerts client
- replay client
- utilities
- backend server
- base site stylesheet
- original Native v2.7 standalone engine

Files intentionally changed are limited to the engine migration/parity surface: chart pane, application settings/bootstrap, state additions for market-line settings, indicator source/warm-up correction, Master Recovery native styling/status, Chart Quality engine label, service worker/versioning, verification/tests and release documentation.

Nothing in this migration intentionally removes AI, drawing tools, risk/reward, replay, indicators, analytics, market intelligence, sharing, workspaces, alerts, security, broker/trading UI, themes or the existing platform shell.
